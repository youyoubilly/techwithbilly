Type-C is becoming increasingly common across new computers, laptops, and even servers. After testing many manufacturers, we found one that could produce this stylish orange Type-C cable with a lovely silicone feel that meets our quality standards.</p> <p>Currently, an extra Type-C-to-USB-A adapter is required if our Mini-KVM works with a host computer that only has USB-A ports.</p> <p></p> <p>We know it\u2019s a bit of a hassle, so we\u2019re working closely with our manufacturer to improve it by integrating an attached Type-C-to-USB-A adapter. Here\u2019s a mock-up of what it might look like.</p> <p></p> <p>This special Type-C cable doesn\u2019t exist on the market and requires our custom OEM production. We\u2019re aiming to include this solution in our final toolkit package for backers, but I'm still crunching the numbers and giving my calculator a workout! To make this happen, we need more support to reduce the overall cost of production for our mini-KVM toolkit. Given the current crowdfunding numbers and production costs, making this custom Type-C cable is becoming more feasible, as it is approaching the break-even point. I\u2019ll keep everyone updated in the Openterface community on any progress!</p> <p>For your part, if you find our project promising and believe the Mini-KVM can make your tech life easier, please consider backing us and spreading the word to your friends. Let's ensure we can enhance the product even further while keeping it wallet-friendly for everyone in this crowdfunding campaign!
